## Your Message to the Hiring Manager

Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at University of Waterloo with hands-on experience building scalable distributed systems. At Groq, I engineered multi-region infrastructure with Kubernetes and Terraform. At Base Power, I optimized performance using Go concurrency and multi-threading, achieving 32% speedups. I'm excited about LinkedIn's focus on next-generation data infrastructure and would love to contribute to scaling systems that impact millions of professionals. Thank you for considering my application!
