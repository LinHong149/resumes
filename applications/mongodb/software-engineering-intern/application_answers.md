# MongoDB Software Engineering Intern - Application Answers

## Why are you interested in this role at MongoDB?

I'm excited about this role because it aligns perfectly with my passion for building internal tools and infrastructure that directly impact productivity. The Internal Engineering team's focus on leveraging AI to make data more actionable resonates with my experience building AI-driven applications and automation tools.

At Walnote AI, I've built scalable REST APIs using FastAPI and Python, developed internal tooling that streamlines workflows, and worked with technologies like Redis, PostgreSQL, and Docker—all central to this role. My experience building "Skip the Walk," a CLI tool that automated workflows using Terraform, demonstrates my interest in the automation and internal tooling aspects MongoDB emphasizes.

I'm particularly excited about the cross-functional collaboration with GTM and business systems teams, similar to my experience collaborating with hardware engineers at FTC Robotics. MongoDB's position at the forefront of the AI era, combined with its commitment to mentorship and intern development, makes this an incredible place to grow as a full-stack engineer while contributing to systems that employees use every day.
