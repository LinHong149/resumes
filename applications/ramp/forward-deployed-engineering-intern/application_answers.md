# Ramp Forward Deployed Engineering Intern - Application Answers

## 1. Please tell us about your two most recent internships/projects.

**Walnote AI - Founding Engineer (July 2025 - Present)**

At Walnote AI, I'm building an end-to-end platform as a founding engineer, which has given me direct experience with the customer-facing, solution-oriented work that defines Forward Deployed Engineering. I designed and implemented a scalable platform using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Redis, delivering production-ready solutions for enterprise customers with real-time data synchronization and event broadcasting. 

What I find most relevant to FDE is how I've had to understand customer needs, scope technical solutions, and deliver end-to-end features—from designing data models that support complex user permissions and role-based access control, to integrating third-party services and architecting distributed systems with Docker and Celery workers. I optimized a video rendering pipeline by 5× through parallelization, demonstrating the kind of performance improvements that matter to enterprise customers. The platform is deployed to production using Vercel, Render, Cloudflare R2, and GitHub Actions CI/CD, serving real users daily.

**Linovation Design - Full Stack Developer (Summer 2024)**

During my internship at Linovation Design, I worked directly with clients to understand their requirements and deliver 8 production websites end-to-end. This experience taught me how to collaborate with non-technical stakeholders, translate business needs into technical solutions, and ship high-quality features that meet business objectives—skills I know are essential for FDE work.

I developed scalable Flask REST APIs with JWT authentication and PostgreSQL integrations, implementing data models and third-party service connections. Working closely with design teams using Figma, I learned to bridge the gap between design and implementation while ensuring the final product met client specifications. All applications were deployed to production using Docker, Vercel, and MongoDB, giving me hands-on experience with the full deployment lifecycle.

## 2. We believe exceptional performance in one area is a good indication of performance in other areas. Do you have any examples of exceptional performance you want to highlight?

I'd highlight my performance in hackathons as an indicator of my ability to deliver exceptional results under pressure and tight deadlines—something I know is crucial in FDE's fast-paced, customer-facing environment.

I've won 10 hackathons, including "Best Use of Terraform" at Hack the North 2024 and placing 4th at Hack the Valley 8 among 80 teams. What I think demonstrates exceptional performance isn't just the wins, but how I consistently deliver end-to-end solutions that solve real problems. For example, at Hack the North, I built "Skip the Walk"—a CLI tool that automated workflows and integrated multiple third-party APIs (Slack, Mappedin) with Terraform orchestration. I didn't just build a demo; I solved an actual pain point for event logistics, which required understanding the problem domain, scoping a solution, and executing quickly.

This same approach translates to my professional work. At Walnote AI, I optimized a video rendering pipeline by 5× through segment-based parallelization—not by following a tutorial, but by understanding the system architecture, identifying bottlenecks, and designing a scalable solution. I believe this pattern of exceptional performance—rapidly understanding complex problems, designing solutions, and executing under constraints—is exactly what FDE needs when working with enterprise customers who have urgent needs and high expectations.

## 3. Do you have professional experience building web services/backend APIs in a production environment?

Yes, I have professional experience building web services and backend APIs in production environments.

**Walnote AI (July 2025 - Present) - Production Backend APIs**

I built scalable REST APIs using FastAPI that are currently serving production traffic. The backend handles real-time data synchronization, event broadcasting through Redis pub/sub, and complex authentication flows with WebSockets. I designed the data models and database schemas in PostgreSQL to support role-based access control and user permissions—exactly the kind of data modeling work mentioned in the FDE role description. The APIs are deployed to Render with Docker containerization, integrated with Cloudflare R2 for object storage, and use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. These services are actively used by enterprise customers, so I've had to handle production issues, optimize performance, and ensure reliability.

**Linovation Design (Summer 2024) - Production REST APIs**

I developed Flask REST APIs with JWT authentication that were deployed to production for 8 client websites. These APIs integrated with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, connected to third-party services, and handled real user traffic. I deployed them using Docker containers to ensure consistent environments, and they're currently running on Vercel and MongoDB Atlas in production.

Both experiences involved the full lifecycle: designing APIs, implementing authentication and authorization, integrating with databases and third-party services, deploying to production, and maintaining them. This aligns directly with FDE's work on extending data models, integrating with third-party systems, and building scalable backend services for enterprise customers.
