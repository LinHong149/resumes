1. Please tell us about your two most recent internships/projects.

At Base Power, a Series B energy trading startup, I worked directly with traders to understand their pain points and deliver full stack solutions end-to-end. I questioned assumptions and identified workarounds that prevented weeks of unnecessary engineering work—exemplifying the "always be scoping" principle. I rewrote the market controller UI using React and Next.js, enabling traders to execute trades within seconds, and built scalable Go microservices with gRPC. I also discovered and resolved performance bottlenecks through systematic investigation, achieving a 32% speedup. This experience taught me to balance quick wins with scalable solutions while working closely with end users in a mission-critical environment.

I'm currently building Walnote.ai as Founder & CTO, where I take extreme ownership of product strategy, engineering, and customer success. I scope customer requirements and iterate rapidly based on feedback, shipping incremental improvements weekly. I built the entire platform from concept to production, processing 1,000+ customer animations with a scalable Python pipeline (FastAPI + Celery), reducing render latency from 12s to 2s. I've raised $20k pre-seed by demonstrating clear business value and customer traction. This entrepreneurial experience has taught me to turn vague customer asks into actionable feature requests, balance building for one customer vs. generalizing for many, and ship fast while maintaining quality—all core FDE skills.

2. We believe exceptional performance in one area is a good indication of performance in other areas. Do you have any examples of exceptional performance you want to highlight?
   Examples outside of work (e.g. from hobbies, sports, or games) are preferred

I've won 10 hackathons at major competitions like Hack the North, Hack the Valley, and ETHGlobal Waterloo. What I find most meaningful is how I've learned to scope problems effectively under extreme time pressure—I quickly identify what's essential vs. nice-to-have, find creative workarounds when blocked, and ship working solutions in 24-36 hours. This ability to question requirements, make rapid architectural decisions, and deliver end-to-end has translated directly to my professional work, where I've contributed to production systems within my first week at Base Power and Groq.

In strength training, I went from benching 45 pounds to 225 pounds over two years—a milestone achieved by less than 0.1% of people. I did this through consistent training, deep research into training methodologies and nutrition science, and systematic improvement. This experience taught me the power of extreme ownership, incremental progress, and data-driven optimization—the same principles I apply to engineering. Just as I researched training methods to maximize results, I research best practices and question assumptions in my technical work to deliver better solutions faster.

As Founder & CTO of Walnote.ai, I've demonstrated exceptional performance in customer development and fundraising. I raised $20k in pre-seed funding by clearly articulating business value and demonstrating customer traction. I've learned to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, negotiate scope with customers, and balance their immediate needs with building scalable solutions. This entrepreneurial experience has given me deep empathy for customer pain points and the drive to solve problems end-to-end—qualities that align perfectly with FDE's customer-first, ownership-driven culture.

3. Do you have professional experience building web services/backend APIs in a production environment?

Yes, I have extensive experience building production backend APIs and web services, with a focus on understanding customer needs and delivering end-to-end solutions:

For Walnote.ai, I built the entire backend infrastructure using FastAPI with RESTful APIs for video generation requests—technologies that align closely with Ramp's stack. I integrated Celery for asynchronous task processing and used PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for data persistence. The system handles real user traffic and processes 1,000+ video generation jobs in production. I implemented proper error handling, retry logic, and monitoring to ensure reliability. What makes this experience particularly relevant to FDE is that I work directly with customers daily—scoping their requirements, iterating based on feedback, and shipping incremental improvements weekly. This has taught me to build APIs that not only work technically but solve real customer problems.

At Base Power, I implemented gRPC services for communication between Python algorithm services and Go microservices, ensuring type safety and reducing serialization overhead by 20%. I worked on real-time market data transformation pipelines that processed financial trading data, requiring careful attention to performance and reliability in a mission-critical environment. I worked directly with traders to understand their needs, which informed how I designed the APIs—prioritizing speed and reliability over unnecessary features. This experience taught me to scope backend work based on actual customer pain points rather than assumptions.

Both experiences have given me a strong foundation in building production systems while maintaining the customer-first mindset that FDE requires—understanding requirements deeply, shipping fast, and iterating based on real user feedback.
