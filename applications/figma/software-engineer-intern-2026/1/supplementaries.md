# Figma Application - Supplementary Questions

## Why are you most excited about your top-ranked team? (Infrastructure)

I'm passionate about building fast, reliable, and scalable systems—from engineering infrastructure with Kubernetes and Terraform at Groq to optimizing performance at Base Power.

## Why do you want to join Figma?

I'm drawn to Figma's mission of making design accessible to all and its commitment to empowering teams to bring ideas to life. As someone who has built fullstack products (Walnote.ai, Trasee) and worked on infrastructure that supports large-scale systems (Groq, Base Power), I'm excited to contribute to a platform that combines beautiful user experiences with robust technical foundations. Figma's collaborative culture and focus on shipping meaningful features aligns perfectly with my experience leading teams and building products that solve real problems. I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work alongside designers, PMs, and engineers to build tools that enable millions of people to create and collaborate more effectively.
