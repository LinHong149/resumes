# Supplemental Questions

## Why do you want to work at Notion?

I'm drawn to Notion's mission of creating a unified platform that helps millions of users seamlessly connect their work. As someone who has experienced the frustration of juggling multiple apps, I'm excited to work on backend systems that power this unified experience at scale.

The backend internship particularly excites me because it offers the opportunity to work on systems serving millions of users. At Base Power, I learned how critical fast, reliable backend systems are when real-time performance directly impacts user experience. I'm passionate about understanding how all parts of a system fit together—from the UI down to the data model—and I see this as a perfect opportunity to deepen that understanding at Notion's scale.

My experience with TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS directly matches Notion's stack. At Walnote.ai, I scaled a platform processing thousands of animations with PostgreSQL and distributed task queues, and I'd love to bring that same problem-solving approach to Notion's backend infrastructure.

Notion's values also resonate with me. The emphasis on thoughtful problem-solving—understanding context before solutions—mirrors my approach at GeeseHacks, where I led infrastructure for 600+ attendees by first understanding the full system. The "put users first" philosophy and pragmatic approach to technology align with my experience building products that impact real workflows.

As a 10× hackathon winner, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. The opportunity to learn from mentors, contribute to features millions depend on, and grow as a backend engineer at Notion is exactly what I'm looking for.
