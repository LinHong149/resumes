# 🎯 Purpose
This repository contains a **LaTeX resume**.  
Your task is to **automatically tailor `resume.tex`** when the user provides a job description, producing a clean, one-page, ATS-compatible `resume_tailored.tex`.

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives

### 1. Analyze the job description
- Extract **role title**, **company**, and **key skills/technologies**.
- Identify the **primary focus areas** (e.g., backend, ML, systems, frontend, infra).
- Compare these keywords to the resume content.

### 2. Adapt and reorder content
- Reorder **Experience** and **Projects** sections so the most relevant appear first.
- Modify bullet points to highlight relevant skills, metrics, and impact.
- Remove or shorten unrelated sections (e.g., robotics or unrelated coursework).
- Never add experiences that do not exist — only **reword or rearrange**.

### 3. Maintain structure and LaTeX integrity
- Follow existing LaTeX macros strictly.
- Do not break, rename, or redefine LaTeX commands or environments.
- Preserve the header, education, and contact format.
- Preserve macro usage such as `\resumeSubheading`, `\resumeItemListStart`, `\resumeItemListEnd`, and `\resumeItem`.

### 4. Keep it concise and one page
- The final output must compile into **one page** on US Letter paper.
- If too long, compress bullet points by merging phrases and removing less relevant details.
- If too short, slightly expand or reuse highly relevant project/experience bullets for balance (without fabricating content).

### 5. Output constraints
- File edited: `resume.tex`
- Output file: `resume_tailored.tex`
- Ensure LaTeX compiles cleanly (balanced environments, no missing braces, no unmatched lists).

## 🧩 Workflow

1. User provides job description (inline or via text file).  
   Example:
```
Job: Software Engineering Intern, Meta
Focus: Distributed Systems, Reliability, Python, Kubernetes
```
2. Tailor `resume.tex` accordingly:
- Emphasize distributed systems, infra, and reliability experience.
- Use wording that reflects job description keywords.
- Move the most relevant experiences and projects to the top of their sections.
- Keep education, awards, and contact sections unless told otherwise.

3. Save final version as `resume_tailored.tex`.

## ✅ Example Behavior

**Input:**
> Job: Backend Engineer Intern at AWS  
> Focus: Go, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloud Infrastructure

**Expected Output Changes:**
- Move cloud-related and backend-related projects/experiences higher.
- Reword experience bullets to mention “Go”, “Terraform”, and “Kubernetes” where factually accurate.
- Shorten unrelated research or non-backend items to keep the resume within one page.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Notes
- The AI acts as a **resume-tailoring assistant**.
- The result should read naturally, emphasizing **action verbs, quantifiable results, and relevant technologies**.
- Do not use placeholders like “X” or “Y”.
- Do not fabricate new roles, companies, or achievements.
- Always preserve factual accuracy and a professional tone.
