- The first section should always be education, and the second should always be skills
- Always include a tagline under the contact information in the header section
- The tagline must always include "10× Hackathon Winner"
- The other tags in the tagline should be tailored based on the job description, highlighting relevant skills/roles (e.g., "Applied Machine Learning Engineer", "Cloud Infrastructure", "Fullstack Engineer", "Software Engineer", "GenAI & LLM Development", "AI/ML Systems", etc.)
- Format the tagline with tags separated by " · " (middle dot), for example: `\small 10× Hackathon Winner · Applied Machine Learning Engineer · Cloud Infrastructure`
